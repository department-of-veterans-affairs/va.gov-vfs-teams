If you're a part of a VA organization creating applications for Veterans to receive benefits; the Veteran Playbook can help you achieve your goals. Vets.gov has developed a modular technical infrastructure that makes it easy for your team to design, develop and launch apps with modern resources like integrated analytics, plug-&-play code and daily deployment.

While writing this playbook, we interviewed business owners, project managers, developers, researchers, and designers across VA to understand their current challenges and leveraged those insights to craft this guide.
