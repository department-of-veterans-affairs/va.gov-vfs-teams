# Vets.gov Content Style Guide

We follow the guidance and rules in the *[Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed.] (http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)* (CMS), and our dictionary of choice is [*Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary*](http://www.merriam-webster.com/) (M-W). The vets.gov Style Guide has exceptions to CMS and M-W, plain-language guidance (see Voice and Tone and Word Choice sections), a list of terms specific to VA and vets.gov, as well as government forms referenced on our site.

(Please email beth@thesocompany.com if you have a suggestion for the style guide.)
