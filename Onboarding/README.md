# Onboarding for VFS teams

## Welcome to the Veteran-facing Services Platform

We're excited that your team will be building an application (or feature) on the Veteran-facing Services Platform! This is the place to get started with onboarding your team.

## Step 1: Understand culture

Have all team members review the:

* [Code of Conduct for working on the Veteran-facing Services Platform](../code-of-conduct.md)

  * If you have questions about the Code of Conduct, ask your DSVA contact.

* [Platform Principles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-vfs-teams/blob/master/Norms/platform-principles.md)

* [Norms for communication](../Norms/norms-communication.md)

  * Review the norms for communication so you understand how to communicate effectively with DSVA, the platform team, and other VFS teams.

* [Norms for using Github](../Norms/Github)

  * Be sure team members review the [tips for creating a Github account](../Norms/Github/README.md#tips-for-creating-a-github-account) **before** they create a Github account in [Step #2](#step-2-request-access-to-tools).

## Step 2: Request access to tools

* [Request access to the tools](request-access-to-tools.md) your team needs to work on the Veteran-facing Services Platform.

## Step 3: Understand norms for using tools

* [Understand how to use the tools](../Norms/norms-tools.md) to do your work.
