2. Build, Measure, Learn! As you go, each of these items represent work that must be completed and signed off on by VSP before a new application launches.

These processes are here to help ensure we're launching features that are:
* in line with VA.gov's standards for design, UX, reliability, and availability
* maintainable over time
* have measurable analytics and success metrics to empower future planning and development

## Launch reviews

Each of these reviews MUST be scheduled with the appropriate VSP contact, and completed by VSP before application launch.

- [ ]   [Accessibility / 508 review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-vfs-teams/blob/master/Request-Reviews/request-508-review.md)
